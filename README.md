# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repo! 🚀  
This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate level ML projects that I’ve worked on while learning the core concepts of Machine Learning using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
